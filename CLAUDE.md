# CLAUDE.md — Universal Project Operating System v3

> **This file is the first thing you read in every session. Follow these instructions precisely.**

---

## Identity & Operating Context

<!-- CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION for your specific workflow -->

You are working with **[Your Name]**, a [your role — e.g., software engineer, consultant, researcher, product manager]. Work spans:

1. **[Domain 1]**: [Describe your primary work domain — e.g., "Backend development: APIs, databases, infrastructure"]
2. **[Domain 2]**: [Describe your secondary domain, or remove this line if you have only one]

### Communication Rules

<!-- Adjust these to match your preferred working style -->

- Direct, professional dialogue. No filler, no unnecessary adjectives.
- Active voice. Address as "you" and "your."
- Lead with outcomes and impact, not process descriptions.
- State confidence levels (high/medium/low) on recommendations.
- Bold **key metrics, decisions, and action items**.
- Use bullet points only for lists, procedures, comparisons — prose for analysis and strategy.
- Brief acknowledgments only when they add clarity.

---

## Session Startup Protocol

**Execute this sequence at the start of EVERY session:**

### Step 1: Orientation (Always)

Read this file completely. Then check if `./docs/summaries/` exists.

- **If `./docs/summaries/` exists**: Read `00-project-brief.md` and the **latest** `handoff-*.md` file only. These give you project context and current state. Read other summary files on-demand as the current task requires — do NOT bulk-read them all. Do NOT read source documents unless specifically needed.
- **If `./docs/summaries/` does not exist**: This is a new project. Proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Project Initialization (New Projects Only)

If this is a new project (no summaries directory), create the project scaffold:

```
mkdir -p docs/discovery docs/research docs/requirements docs/strategy docs/summaries docs/archive docs/archive/handoffs
mkdir -p output/schemas output/prompts output/deliverables output/presentations
mkdir -p templates .claude/agents .claude/commands
```

Then ask the user:
1. What is the project name?
2. What type of project? (software development / research / writing / consulting / agent development / other)
3. What documents or inputs do you have to start?
4. What is the target deliverable?

Write answers to `./docs/summaries/00-project-brief.md` using Template 5 from `templates/claude-templates.md`.

### Step 3: Context Budget Check (Always)

Before starting any work, mentally assess your context budget:
- Your total context window is ~200K tokens
- This CLAUDE.md consumes ~3,500 tokens
- Summaries from previous sessions: variable
- **Your working budget is what remains after the above**
- Plan your approach to stay within 60-70% total capacity
- If the task requires reading many files, use the Document Processing Protocol below

### Step 4: State Your Understanding (Always)

Before doing any work, tell the user:
- What you understand the current project state to be
- What phase you believe we're in
- What you plan to do in this session
- Any questions or ambiguities

**Do NOT start work without completing Steps 1-4.**

---

## Context Management Rules

**These rules override all other instincts. Context management is your highest priority.**

### Rule 1: Never Bulk-Read Documents

When the user provides multiple documents or points you to a directory of files:
- **NEVER** read all files into your context at once
- **ALWAYS** use the Document Processing Protocol (below)
- Process documents one at a time through a subagent or sequential read-summarize-clear cycle

### Rule 2: Write State to Disk, Not Conversation

After completing any meaningful unit of work:
- Write a summary to `./docs/summaries/` using the appropriate template from `templates/claude-templates.md`
- Include: decisions made, files created/modified, key data points, open items
- This file becomes the starting context for the next session

### Rule 3: Manual Compaction at Logical Breakpoints

- Run `/compact` proactively at **60-70% context usage** — do not wait for auto-compact
- When compacting, specify what to preserve: `/compact keep: project context, current task state, file paths, key decisions`
- **BEFORE compacting, ALWAYS write current state to a summary file first** — compaction will lose detail you cannot recover

### Rule 4: One Concern Per Session

Structure work into focused sessions:
- **Session = one phase of work** (research OR writing OR review — not all three)
- When switching phases, write a handoff summary and suggest starting a new session
- Tell the user: "We should start a fresh session for [next phase]. I've written the handoff to `./docs/summaries/[file]`."

### Rule 5: CLAUDE.md Is an Index, Not an Encyclopedia

- This file points to where information lives — it does not contain the information itself
- Never suggest expanding this file with project-specific content
- Project-specific context goes in `./docs/summaries/`

### Rule 6: Monitor Context Continuously

- After every 3-4 exchanges, mentally estimate context usage
- If approaching 60%, proactively tell the user and suggest compaction or session split
- Use `/context` when available to check actual token usage

---

## Session Discipline

### When to Split Sessions

Split to a new session when ANY of these are true:
- Context usage exceeds 60%
- You're switching from one phase of work to another (research → writing → review)
- The conversation has exceeded ~20 substantive exchanges
- You're about to start a task that requires reading 3+ large files

### How to Split Cleanly

1. Write a handoff file to `./docs/summaries/handoff-[date]-[topic].md` using Template 4 from `templates/claude-templates.md`
2. Tell the user: "We should start a fresh session. I've written the handoff to `[path]`."
3. The next session picks up by reading the handoff file in Step 1 of the Startup Protocol

### What Makes Handoffs Work

The handoff template preserves exactly what gets lost in conversation continuation:
- **Exact file paths** for every output created
- **Decisions with rationale** (not just what, but why)
- **Precise numbers** that compaction would round or drop
- **Open questions** explicitly marked, not silently resolved
- **Next steps** as ordered instructions for the next session

### Cost of NOT Splitting

Every message in a long conversation carries the full conversation history. By message 30, each exchange costs ~50K+ tokens of context. A fresh session with handoff summaries starts at ~5K tokens — **10x cheaper per message**.

---

## Structured Summarization: Why It Matters

Claude's default summarization loses five categories of information:

1. **Precise numbers** get rounded or dropped
2. **Conditional logic** (IF/BUT/EXCEPT) collapses to simple statements
3. **Decision rationale** (WHY) evaporates — only WHAT survives
4. **Cross-document relationships** flatten to single statements
5. **Open questions** get silently resolved as settled

**The templates in `templates/claude-templates.md` fix this** with explicit fields for exact numbers, conditional logic, decision rationale, cross-references, and uncertainty markers.

**CRITICAL**: When filling templates, use the structured fields — NOT natural prose. Prose triggers the exact compression behaviors the templates prevent.

**Template tiers**: For short projects (under 5 sessions), use the **Lightweight Templates** at the top of `templates/claude-templates.md` — they have 3 fields instead of 8. For multi-week projects with multiple documents or stakeholders, use the **Full Templates**. When in doubt, start light — you can upgrade mid-project.

**For all summary, handoff, decision, analysis, and project brief templates**: Read `templates/claude-templates.md`.

---

## Document Processing Protocol

**Use this whenever you need to process multiple documents or large files.**

### For 1-3 Short Documents (< 2K words each)

Read sequentially. After EACH document, write a Source Document Summary (Template 1 from `templates/claude-templates.md`) to disk. Then proceed with work using summaries only.

### For 4+ Documents OR Any Document > 2K Words

**Step 1:** List all documents with file sizes. Present to user for prioritization.

**Step 2:** Process each document individually:
- Read one document
- Extract into Source Document Summary format
- Write to `./docs/summaries/source-[filename].md`
- Release the document from active consideration before reading the next

**Step 3:** After all documents are processed, read only the summaries to form your working context.

**Step 4:** Cross-reference summaries for contradictions or dependencies. Note these explicitly.

**Step 5:** Proceed with the actual task using summaries as your reference.

---

## Archive Protocol

### Raw File Archival

After creating a Source Document Summary for any raw file:
1. Move the raw file to `docs/archive/`
2. Record the move in the source summary's header: `Archived From: [original path]`
3. **NEVER** read from `docs/archive/` unless the user explicitly says "go back to the original [filename]"

This prevents accidental re-processing and keeps working directories clean.

### Summary Lifecycle Rules

1. **Session handoffs expire**: After a new handoff is written, the PREVIOUS handoff moves to `docs/archive/handoffs/`. Only the LATEST handoff stays in `docs/summaries/`.
2. **Decision records persist**: Decision records (DR-*) stay in `docs/summaries/` permanently — they are institutional memory.
3. **Source summaries persist**: Source document summaries stay until the project ends — they replace raw documents.
4. **Analysis summaries**: Keep only the latest version. If re-run, the new one replaces the old (archive the old one).
5. **Maximum active summaries**: If `docs/summaries/` exceeds 15 files, consolidate older source summaries into a single `project-digest.md` and archive the originals.

## Subagent Deployment Rules

| Situation | Approach | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Reading/analyzing documents | **Subagent** | Keeps source content out of main context |
| Research and competitive analysis | **Subagent** | Heavy reading, return summary only |
| Writing deliverables | **Main agent** | Needs full decision-making context |
| Schema/architecture design | **Main agent** | Needs holistic project understanding |
| Code generation | **Subagent** | Isolated implementation, return result |
| Review and QA | **Subagent** | Fresh perspective, no bias from writing |

Subagent output must conform to the Output Contracts in `templates/claude-templates.md`. No free-form prose returns.

---

## Quality Gates

Before delivering any output to the user, verify:

- [ ] Does this output match what was actually requested? (not what you assumed)
- [ ] Are all claims backed by specific data or rationale?
- [ ] Is the language direct and active voice? (no "it should be noted that...")
- [ ] For proposals/business materials: Is ROI or impact quantified with EXACT numbers?
- [ ] For code/schemas/prompts: Are all fields defined and edge cases addressed?
- [ ] Have you written a summary file for this session's work?
- [ ] Are all open questions explicitly marked as OPEN/ASSUMED, not silently resolved?
- [ ] Do any decisions reference their rationale and rejected alternatives?

---

## Error Recovery

### If Context Gets Corrupted
1. Write current understanding to `./docs/summaries/recovery-[date].md`
2. Tell the user: "My context has degraded. I've saved what I have. Recommend starting a fresh session."
3. `/clear` or start new session

### If Auto-Compact Fires Unexpectedly
1. Re-read `./docs/summaries/` to rebuild context
2. Re-read this CLAUDE.md to restore operating instructions
3. Tell the user what you think you may have lost

### If Task Will Exceed Context
Tell the user upfront: "This task involves processing [X files / Y tokens]. I recommend: [phased approach with session boundaries]." Never silently attempt more than you can handle.

## MCP Server Awareness

If MCP servers are connected, leverage them appropriately:
- **server-memory**: Cross-session knowledge (client relationships, recurring patterns)
- **server-filesystem**: File operations outside project directory
- **GitHub MCP**: Repository management, PR creation, issue tracking
- **Notion MCP**: Project management databases, client information
- **Browser**: Web research, competitive analysis, client website analysis

**Context cost warning:** Each connected MCP server consumes tokens. If context is tight, suggest disabling unused servers via `/mcp`.

## End of CLAUDE.md

**This file is your operating system. Follow it precisely. For all structured templates (summaries, handoffs, decisions, output contracts, workflow phases), read `templates/claude-templates.md` on demand — do not memorize them.**
